					<p>Although Netflix provides access to their streaming apps across several different platforms, their Desktop Web App still remains a major source of registrations and traffic. In 2015, around 42 percent of all Netflix signups were registered for desktops or laptops. Phones came in a distant second, with 27 percent of all signups, followed by 21 percent for televisions and 10 percent for tablets.
</p>
<p>People shift platforms after some time using the service (only 26 percent of viewers used a desktop or laptop as their primary devices versus the 42 percent reported as signups). But desktop still represents the primary gateway through which new users discover Netflix, and therefore a premium should be placed on the user experience on Web. In particular, Netflix should focus on the new user experience on the Web platform.</p>
<p>Netflix prides itself on its recommendations engine. As well it should, it’s a very robust set of algorithms that does quite well at making suggestions of what to watch based on past behavior. However, the algorithm only works for existing users that have watched a certain amount of content, and have rated a certain number of movies or shows.</p>
<p>However, it is inadvisable to just throw new users onto the grid. Users can become overwhelmed, confused, determine there is “nothing good to watch”, and leave. There are a couple ways around this.</p>
<p>1. You can ask users what mood they’re in, and have them choose a genre. This will whittle down the choices that a user has to make, and lead them to a more focused set of movies and tv shows.</p>
